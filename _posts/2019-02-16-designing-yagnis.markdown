Hello, World!

I'm designing a simple programming language (so I must have lost my mind).
It is just a tiny experiment.
I got a little sick of watching how other people choose some tools and languages
I wouldn't pick (matter of taste), and I decided to stop complaining
and do something.

I'll be uploading information about its syntax
and features during the next few days. In my opinion,
I must avoid to include too much into the language, so I called it _Yagnis_
to remember constantly 'it isn't gonna need this or that'.

Other languages are serving as inspiration for me,
namely Jai, Ada, C/C++, C#, Kotlin, Rust, Erlang... and more.
I'll accept also feedback (in some degree), so don't be shy and comment!

That's all for now. More news coming soon.
