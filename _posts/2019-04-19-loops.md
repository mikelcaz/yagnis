This post is focused on basic loop syntax. There is some features that I would like to add in the future that are not considered here.

## For (each) loop

```
array : []int = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

for i : in array {
    // i ...
}
```

or more idiomatic:

```
for each : in array {
    // each ...
}
```

: )

### For loop with ranges

> Note how `each` is not a keyword, but an identifier. Also, there is a parallelism between the `in` keyword and the assignment operator (`=`).

```
// Full verbosity.
for each : i32 in 0 <= .. < 256 {
    // each ...
}

// With type inference.
for each : in 0 <= .. < 256 {
    // each ...
}

// Playing with the inclusion of the ends.
for each : in -1 < .. <= 255 {
    // each ...
}

// Reversed range.
for each : in 256 > .. => 0 {
    // each ...
}
```

### For loop with implicit iterator

```
array : []int = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

for in array {
    // ...
}
```

(I hate this form, I may remove it later).

## While loop

```
a = 0
while a < 256 {
    a += 1
}
```

## Repeat-while loop

```
a = 0
repeat while a < 256 {
    a += 1
}
```

Pros:

- This loop can be quickly turned into a `while` loop and vice versa.
- The condition works consistently with `if`, `for` and `while` (like in C).
- The braces could be removed in the future easier than in other versions.
- Only one additional keyword (like in C).
- It can be less confusing and prevent errors related with copy-and-paste and dangling empty `while`s (like Pascal achieves).

Cons:

- It also can be more confusing, because the condition is before the block ('Repeat? Oh, yes, now I remember...').
- Slightly more verbose (I considered `repeat if`, but semantically it would be more trouble than it is worth).
